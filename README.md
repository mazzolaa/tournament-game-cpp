Tournament Fighting Game 

C++ console app. Tournament fighting game for two players. Uses polymorphism to create 5 unique character classes with their own special abilities,
armor grade, and hit points. Each player assembles a team and their characters face off one at a time until one player is out of usable characters.
Combat is turn based with attack values and defense values based on rolls of dice with different numbers of faces.
The player with remaining characters is the winner.

The files can be compiled into an executable named "Tourney" using the 'make' command using the g++ compiler.
